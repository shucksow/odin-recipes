    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4-6 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro or parsley (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Crumbled feta cheese</li>
    </ul> 

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chopped onion and red bell pepper. Cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add minced garlic, ground cumin, smoked paprika, and ground cayenne pepper to the skillet. Stir and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Pour in the diced tomatoes with their juices. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly.</li>
        <li>Using a spoon, make small wells in the tomato sauce. Crack the eggs one by one into the wells.</li>
        <li>Cover the skillet and let the eggs cook in the tomato sauce until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny, about 5-7 minutes. If you prefer firmer yolks, cook for a few minutes longer.</li>
        <li>Once the eggs are cooked to your liking, remove the skillet from heat. Garnish with chopped cilantro or parsley and crumbled feta cheese if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve the Shakshuka hot directly from the skillet, with crusty bread or pita for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
