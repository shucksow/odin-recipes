        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (optional, for added heat)</li>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix together minced garlic, ground cumin, paprika, turmeric, coriander, cinnamon, cayenne pepper (if using), lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and black pepper to form a marinade.</li>
        <li>Add the thinly sliced chicken to the marinade, ensuring it's well coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or ideally up to 2 hours to allow the flavors to develop.</li>
        <li>Preheat a grill pan or skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Once the pan is hot, add the marinated chicken slices in a single layer. Cook for 5-6 minutes on each side, or until the chicken is fully cooked and nicely charred.</li>
        <li>While the chicken is cooking, warm the pita bread or flatbread.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is done, remove it from the pan and let it rest for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>To assemble the chicken shawarma wraps, place a generous portion of the cooked chicken onto each warmed pita bread. Add your desired toppings such as sliced tomatoes, lettuce, red onion, cucumber, and sauces like tahini or yogurt sauce.</li>
        <li>Roll up the pita bread tightly around the filling to form a wrap.</li>
        <li>Serve the chicken shawarma wraps immediately and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This recipe yields flavorful and juicy chicken shawarma that's perfect for wrapping in pita bread or flatbread along with your favorite toppings and sauces.</p>
